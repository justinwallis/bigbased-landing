- [ ] Center the BB icon inside the ribbon
- [ ] Add Logo Carousel or Marquee for Stack:
       - Example: Logo Carousel (https://21st.dev/cult-ui/logo-carousel/default)
       - Example: Marquee (https://21st.dev/lukacho/marquee/default)

**Design Ideas**
      
- [ ] Cool Button Border (Possibly): https://21st.dev/DavidHDev/star-border/default
- [ ] Can the Login / Register be a Popout thing? wld be slick - https://21st.dev/aceternity/navbar-menu/default
- [ ] Would Typewriter effect be too much? might look good somewhere: https://21st.dev/danielpetho/typewriter/default
- [ ] What about a blur fade somewhere? maybe not, just an idea.  Or instead of tyypewrier myb: https://21st.dev/magicui/blur-fade/default
- [ ] Might be chill to add this to a card somewhere. myb not tho.. (Slower and maybe grey/white, instead of color if possible): https://21st.dev/jatin-yadav05/glowing-card/default
- [ ] Should we build the AI on BigBased.app? Prob just keep on the .AI. (app.bigbased.ai)    .app Could be reserved for smth else tho.

BigBased.Tech - Or should this site be BigBased.io
- [ ] Quick Link to BigBased.AI, BigBased.com, BigBased.Dev. Some dope background animation also prob?  Maybe like a Site preview box/card since we only have 1 logo at this point

BigBased.Dev  ToDo (After we are finished w BB.AI, and fully locked in)      
- [ ] Link to Based Hackathon website. We could just do a quick page on BasedHackathon.com that just points to the discord for now)
- [ ] Link to Based College Website / App (discord for now, until we get discord clone made, link in main business doc)
- [ ] I need to Make the Discord, then update the link on the site
- [ ] Connect Site with the stripe
- [ ] Video Example of AI?
- [ ] TopLeft logo is the last thing to load, and has a white box in it's place before it loads. Dark grey background gets loaded a little late. distracting
- [ ] Construct TOS
- [ ] Install Favicons: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1toLwxlhi-_9ZPNcwlY1pECz_oo7HY-Q9?usp=drive_link
- [ ] 

Other Ideas:
- [ ] What do we do with BasedTicker.com?
