              retain certain rights to moderate content and suspend users if
              necessary.

            <p>
              Since BigBased.AI offers AI-based services, cryptocurrency tools,

            <p>
              To protect BigBased.AI from legal disputes, all disagreements must
              go through binding arbitration.
            </p>

              All disputes will be settled through arbitration, not lawsuits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users waive their right to class-action lawsuits against
              BigBased.AI.
