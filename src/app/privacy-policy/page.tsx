            At BigBased.AI, we prioritize user privacy and data protection,
            especially when it comes to interactions with AI models. Many AI
            platforms collect, store, and analyze user interactions
            indefinitely, but BigBased.AI follows a decentralized, privacy-first
            approach to ensure your data remains secure, anonymous, and never
            exploited. This post will break down how BigBased.AI’s AI models
            handle user data, what is stored (and what isn’t), and what steps we
            take to keep AI interactions private.

              5️ Why Big Tech Fears Decentralized AI & Privacy-Based Web3 Models
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Tech giants profit from user data collection and centralized
              control. A privacy-first, decentralized AI ecosystem disrupts
              their business model.
            </p>
            <ul className="ml-5 mt-2 list-disc">
              <li>
                Google & Microsoft AI models rely on user interactions for
                training – BigBased.AI does NOT.
              </li>
              <li>
                Meta (Facebook) monetizes user profiles and AI-driven behavioral

              </li>
              <li>
                Centralized AI models can be censored or politically biased –
                BigBased.AI is built to be free from Big Tech control.

            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Decentralized AI eliminates the need for Big Tech, allowing users
              to interact with AI in a censorship-free, privacy-protected
